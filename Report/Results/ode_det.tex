The deterministic model, illustrated in system \ref{eq:System1} and implemented by the authors using the standard ode45 function in Matlab, resulted in the production of Figure \ref{fig:det_fitting}.

 On our end, as said before, we employed the use of \textit{solve\_ivp}, from Scipy\cite{2020SciPy-NMeth} with default parameters, in python and obtained a comparable result as shown in Figure \ref{solve_ivp}. Due to the deterministic nature of the simulation we didn't perform multiple runs.
