Modeling enables a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena. Most system are well described by deterministic models, which have a good balance between their descriptive power and simplicity, though they can be too superficial in capturing inherited variability of real-world  events. In such cases stochastic modeling better express complex system unpredictability. In the paper both deterministic and stochastic models are built, the latter, in particular, is used to study the system evolution under the perturbation of demographic parameters. \par
The authors point out how the stochastic setting is best suited in this case, since real hospitalization data contains noise. Fundamental in this case is to assess if these perturbations are significant and if, instead, the deterministic model could be a better option.
